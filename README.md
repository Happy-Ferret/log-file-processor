# Log File Processor

A Rust experiment in quickly parsing the specialist types of log files
we have at work (there is no work IP in this repo, it is all generic
code).

The aim was to go as fast as possible while keeping clear code.

A branch f-experiments contains various early variants, the master
branch has been pruned down to just my chosen one.
